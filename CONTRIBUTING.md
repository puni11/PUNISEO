## Commit Message Format

We use conventional commits:

- `feat:` — New feature
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `style:` — UI/CSS changes (no logic change)
- `refactor:` — Code refactoring
- `docs:` — Documentation
- `chore:` — Maintenance tasks

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Include a clear description of what changed and why
- Update documentation if your change affects the public API or user-facing behavior
- Make sure the build passes before requesting review

## Reporting Issues

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/crawlseo/crawlseo/issues)
- Search existing issues before creating a new one
- Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior

## Code Style

- TypeScript for all code
- Use existing patterns in the codebase as a guide
- Follow the project's component and file structure conventions
- No unnecessary abstractions — keep it simple
